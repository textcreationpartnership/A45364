         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince by too-apparent demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trations it appeares, that the King (deluded, and Å¿educed by the evill CounÅ¿els of a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant party, whoÅ¿e Spirits are ill-affected to the publike peace of this Kingdome) intendeth to make warre againÅ¿t the Parliament, and that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the Å¿ame intention, he hath already col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and levyed great forces both of HorÅ¿e and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65620:3"/> Foot, to maintain the former reÅ¿olution throughout the County of <hi>York,</hi> and a multitude of PapiÅ¿ts, and other reÅ¿olute and ill-diÅ¿poÅ¿ed perÅ¿ons in other Counties adjacent; all which doe apparently inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate his reÅ¿olution to make warre againÅ¿t the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: They have therefore after a Å¿erious and deliberate conÅ¿ideration thereof, propounded cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine PropoÅ¿itions to the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> deÅ¿iring their aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance in a preÅ¿ent ayde for the Å¿ecurity of both HouÅ¿es; for otherwiÅ¿e the pernicious malice of Å¿uch deÅ¿perate perÅ¿ons, imployed in Å¿o horrid, and unnaturall an Act, will be ready to commit all outrage and violence, which will conÅ¿equently tend to the diÅ¿Å¿olution of this preÅ¿ent governement, the violation of the Priviledges of Parliament, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truction of our Religion, and all hopes in refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Church, to the perpetuall ruine of the Lawes, the liberty and propriety of the Subjects. Wherefore the Lords and Commons, conÅ¿idering how great an obligation doth lie upon them in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ConÅ¿cience, and Duty, according to the high truÅ¿t repoÅ¿ed in them by the whole Kingdom, to uÅ¿e all poÅ¿Å¿ible meanes in Å¿uch caÅ¿es for the timely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Å¿o great and irrecoverable evils, have thought it expedient to publiÅ¿h their Å¿ence and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenÅ¿ions of theÅ¿e imminent dangers; thereby to excite and extimulate all well-affected perÅ¿ons to contribute their reÅ¿pective aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations neceÅ¿Å¿ary for the oppoÅ¿ing and Å¿uppreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing the trayterous attempts of thoÅ¿e malignant Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. The Citie of <hi>London</hi> Å¿eemed to Å¿ympathize
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65620:3"/> exceedingly with theÅ¿e PropoÅ¿itions: and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament were not more ready to propound them, then they as ready to performe, and obey the Å¿ame.</p>
            <p>LaÅ¿t TueÅ¿day the Lord Maior, Court of Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Common-Councell-men, met at <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> in diÅ¿tribution of their affections, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ultations what Å¿hould be diÅ¿penÅ¿ed out of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie TreaÅ¿urie. Every Company likewiÅ¿e did meet at their Halls, and there diÅ¿tributed every man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pectively; for men had better diÅ¿penÅ¿e with their Money and Plate, conditionally to receive the Å¿ame with intereÅ¿t, and have the publike faith of the whole Kingdome engaged for the Å¿ecurity thereof, then being parÅ¿imonious and refractory, perhaps have that Money and Plate taken violently from them by inteÅ¿tine enemies: and let any man judge, Whether the prevention of Å¿uch impendent dangers be not more plauÅ¿ible then the policy and diligence of a Remedie, when extremity Å¿hall drive a man to the laÅ¿t hopes: It is more eaÅ¿ie to keepe out of dangers, then to get out of them. Wherefore it were more prudent for men (that can Å¿pare mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, without any detriment or prejudice to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves) to diÅ¿penÅ¿e with what money they can, for the conÅ¿ervation of peace voluntarily, then when violent warre Å¿hall come ruÅ¿hing in upon us, to diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penÅ¿e then with compulÅ¿ion; or elÅ¿e perhaps to be reduced to an eÅ¿tate not leÅ¿Å¿e miÅ¿erable then Å¿laviÅ¿h. But not to hold the Readers deÅ¿iring eye in any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Å¿uÅ¿penÅ¿e, I will delineate, and expreÅ¿Å¿e the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular proportion of moneys gathered in <hi>London.</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:65620:4"/> The Lord Maior, Court of Aldermen, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Councell-men, Å¿itting at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> made a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall determination of their intents, and have diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burÅ¿ed fifty thouÅ¿and pounds, partly out of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie TreaÅ¿ury, and partly out of their owne purÅ¿es; and will maintaine fifty HorÅ¿e. MoÅ¿t of the twelve Companies have diÅ¿penÅ¿ed twenty thouÅ¿and pounds a piece; and of the other Companies, ten thouÅ¿and pounds is the leaÅ¿t that any have disbuÅ¿ed: beÅ¿ides an infinite number of Plate that is lent, of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne worth. Some Companies maintain three-Å¿core HorÅ¿e, Å¿ome forty, Å¿ome thirty, but twenty is the leaÅ¿t that any Company maintaines, with as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny HorÅ¿e men: for the preÅ¿ervation of the publike peace and tranquility of the Kingdome, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿onall defence of the King, and both HouÅ¿es of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. The affection of no man was meaÅ¿ured by any limitation, but according to the proportion of his offer, he expreÅ¿Å¿ed his good will to this Å¿ervice. But according to the appointment and direction of both HouÅ¿es of Parliament, the Money, Plate, HorÅ¿e, or HorÅ¿e-men were delivered to Sir <hi>Iohn WollaÅ¿ton,</hi> Knight and Alderman, Alderman <hi>TowÅ¿e,</hi> Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Warner,</hi> and Alderman <hi>Andrewes:</hi> for they were Ordered to be TreaÅ¿urers to receive all the Money and Plate, brought in for the purpoÅ¿es afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿aid. And the Acquittances of them, or of any two of them (as it was ordered by the Parliament) for the Receit of the Å¿ame is a Å¿ufficient ground for the Party Å¿o lending Money, or Plate, to demand the Å¿ame againe with intereÅ¿t; and likewiÅ¿e conÅ¿iderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65620:4"/> for the faÅ¿hion of the Plate. The totall Å¿umme of all the Moneys and Plate that the Citie hath brought in to the Å¿aid Aldermen, is Å¿uppoÅ¿ed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to above ten hundred thouÅ¿and pounds: the HorÅ¿e and HorÅ¿e-men to the number of about eight hundred and fifty; but there are many more HorÅ¿e in preparation to bee Å¿ent.</p>
